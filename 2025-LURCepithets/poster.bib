  abstract = {Epithet phrases in Lebanese Arabic can occur as resumptive elements and as bound variables only when they appear with a pronominal morpheme that can be used anaphorically. Based on this generalization, we argue that epithet phrases are not intrinsically pronominal. Rather, it is the anaphoric pronominal element which occurs with those epithet phrases that accounts for their pronominal behavior. We discuss the cross-linguistic consequences of this claim by examining the behavior of epithet phrases in a language, Moroccan Arabic, where epithet phrases cannot be used anaphorically as bound variables or as resumptive elements. Furthermore, the distribution of epithet phrases is regulated by a constraint that prevents these elements from being linked to the most local operator. This restriction is responsible for the limited distribution of resumptive epithet phrases, and its effects could mislead one into assuming that epithet phrases cannot be used as resumptive elements.},

  abstract = {In this squib, we consider whether the unacceptability that results when a pronoun partially overlaps in reference with an antecedent is reducible to a Condition B violation. Three pieces of evidence suggest that it can be: (1) the effect is ameliorated when the pronoun is suffciently distant from the antecedent; (2) the effect is only present when the antecedent c-commands the pronoun; (3) the effect is significantly lessened in the presence of focus. However, there are two environments where Partially-Overlapping Reference is acceptable where fully overlapping reference is not: (1) in certain types of questions; (2) in certain types of adjuncts. These differences make it hard to argue that the effect is a simple Condition B violation. In addition, we discuss what the environments where partially overlapping reference is and is not acceptable can tell us about how Condition B should be formulated.},

  abstract = {The notion of logophoricity is used to characterize linguistic elements sensitive to perspective. The goal of this review is to examine this notion by focusing on the behavior of so-called exempt reflexives. It has long been observed that reflexives can be exempt from Condition A of Binding Theory under perspectival conditions. The distribution of exempt reflexives can thus be examined to identify what perspectival properties are grammatically relevant and thereby specify the definition of logophoricity. In this article, I first review various proposals about this issue; in particular, the grammatical relevance of perspective for exempt reflexives has been explored in comparison with so-called logophoric pronouns as well as in the context of literary and philosophical studies. Second, after providing tools for exploring the perspectival properties of exempt reflexives crosslinguistically, I present my own hypothesis explaining why reflexives can superficially be exempt from Condition A under logophoric conditions.},

  abstract = {In this paper we take a close look at the behaviour of German demonstrative pronouns (DPros) in the complement clauses of propositional attitude verbs. Building on and partially revising Hinterwimmer and Bosch (2016), we show that DPros are anti-logophoric pronouns whose behaviour is similar (though not identical) to that of epithets (Dubinsky and Hamilton 1998, Schlenker 2005, and Patel-Grosz 2014). In particular, we argue that while Hinterwimmer and Bosch (2016) were right in assuming that DPros are prohibited from being bound by or co-referring with the currently most prominent perspective holder, they were wrong in assuming that the subjects of propositional attitude verbs are necessarily the most prominent perspective holders with respect to the DPros contained in their complement clauses. Evidence for this comes from two sources: First, in cases where a sentence with a propositional attitude verb is the complement of another propositional attitude verb in the matrix clause, a DPro contained in the complement clause of the lower propositional attitude verb can be bound by the subject of that verb, but not by the subject of the higher one. Secondly, if the speaker makes her own perspective particularly prominent by using an evaluative expression in referring to (the individual denoted by) the subject of a propositional attitude verb α, a DPro contained in the complement clause of α can at least for some speakers be interpreted as bound by the subject of α. We therefore now propose a pragmatic strategy that determines the most prominent perspective holder not only for the novel data discussed in this paper, but also for the data discussed in Hinterwimmer and Bosch (2016). Finally, we argue that the allergy of DPros against (maximally prominent) perspective holders is related to their status as demonstrative items which as such require an external reference point.},

They are revealing of the perspective from which the utterance is made, and they can have a dramatic impact on how current and future utterances are perceived. This, despite the fact that speakers are invariably hard-pressed to articulate what they mean. I develop a general theory of these volatile, indispensable meanings. The theory is built around a class of expressive indices. These determine the expressive setting of the context of interpretation. Expressive morphemes act on that context, actively changing its expressive setting. The theory is multidimensional in the sense that descriptives and expressives are fundamentally different but receive a unified logical treatment.},

  abstract = {Following a general line explored by Bolinger, Reinhart, Levinson and Schein, we seek to derive Condition C of the Binding Theory from a Gricean maxim of minimization (Minimize Restrictors!), which specifies that a definite description the A B is deviant if A could be dropped without affecting (i) the denotation of the description, and (ii) its various pragmatic effects. Thus the small (American) President is deviant if it is assumed that there is a single (American) President, as small contributes neither to (i) nor to (ii). By contrast, the stupid (American) President is entirely natural: although stupid does not affect (i), it contributes pragmatic information about the speaker's (negative) attitude towards the denotation of the description. If pronouns are treated as short descriptions and if the semantics is set up in a slightly non-standard fashion, Part (i) of Minimize Restrictors! can derive the standard cases of Condition C. Furthermore, Part (ii) accounts for some exceptions to Condition C. First, an element may contribute expressive information about the speaker's attitude towards the denotation of the description, as is the case of epithets (e.g. the idiot expresses the speaker's negative attitude towards the person in question). Second, an element may serve a disambiguating function, as happens in very long sentences in which a definite description is acceptable in violation of Condition C (e.g. the linguist in: [A linguist working on Binding Theory]i was so devoid of any moral sense that hei forced [a physicist working on particles]k to hire [the linguist's]i girlfriend in hisk lab.)},
